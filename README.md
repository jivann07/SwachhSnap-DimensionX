# SwachhSnap-DimensionX
SwachhSnap is a smart waste management platform designed to solve the issue of unsegregated municipal waste. The solution integrates Google Gemini API (Multimodal AI) to automatically classify waste into categories (Plastic, Metal, Organic) from user-uploaded images.

Key Features:

AI Classification: Uses Gemini Vision to identify waste types with 90% accuracy.

Smart Routing: Plots waste locations on Google Maps to optimize collection routes for municipal trucks.

Real-time Data: Uses Firebase to store reports and update the admin dashboard instantly.

This project addresses the 'Sustainability' and 'Smart City' tracks by reducing landfill overflow and improving recycling efficiency.
